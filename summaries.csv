One such perturbation is the dual loss of the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 ATPase subunits, which has recently been implicated in rare cancers such as small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT)2-5, SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcomas6 and dedifferentiated endometrial carcinomas7. The consequences of SMARCA4/2 dual loss on the biochemical composition of the complex, chromatin targeting and remodeling capabilities, and subcomplex identity (BAF vs. PBAF) in these cancers are unknown.  Here, we leverage SCCOHT cell lines to identify an unexpected ATPase module of mSWI/SNF subunits. Using biochemical and genome-wide profiling assays, we found that the incorporation of the ATPase module is a critical step in the functional specification of BAF and PBAF subcomplexes. Furthermore, by utilizing ATPase mutant variants, we found that the ATPase module mediates two separate and concurrent mSWI/SNF targeting mechanisms, evenly split between catalytically-independent targeting to primed enhancers/promoters and catalytically-dependent targeting to de novo enhancers. Finally, by linking these distinct sites to separate tumor-suppressive gene expression programs across ovarian tissues , we clarify the mechanistic consequences of SMARCA4/2 loss dual loss in these rare tumors.",Homo sapiens
200128119,GSE128119,COX-2 mediates tumor-stromal Prolactin signaling to initiate tumorigenesis [ChIP-seq],"Tumor-stromal communication within the microenvironment contributes to initiation of metastasis and may present a therapeutic opportunity. Using serial single cell RNA-sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find upregulation of Prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lung expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand Prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2). PGE-2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the nuclear orphan receptor NR4A (Nur77), with Prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-Retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of Prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib abrogates Prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation. Across multiple human cancers, COX-2, Prolactin, and Prolactin receptor show consistent differential expression in tumor and stromal compartments. Such paracrine crosstalk may thus contribute to the documented efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer suppression.",Homo sapiens

200120993,GSE120993,Withdrawal of MEK1/2 inhibitor reverses acquired resistance driven by BRAF amplification but drives EMT and chemoresistance in cells with amplified KRAS,"Acquired resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors can arise through amplification of BRAFV600E or KRASG13D to reinstate ERK1/2 signalling. Here we show that BRAFV600E amplification and selumetinib resistance are fully reversible following drug withdrawal. Resistant cells with BRAFV600E amplification become addicted to selumetinib to maintain a precise level of ERK1/2 signalling (2-3% of total ERK1/2 active, here quantified by mass spectrometry), that is optimal for cell survival and proliferation. The magnitude of ERK1/2 activation following selumetinib withdrawal (~20% active) drives a p57KIP2-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence or expression of NOXA and cell death, which selects against those cells with amplified BRAFV600E. ERK1/2-dependent p57KIP2 expression is required for loss of BRAFV600E amplification and determines the rate of reversal of selumetinib resistance. Furthermore, growth of selumetinib-resistant cells with BRAFV600E amplification as tumour xenografts is inhibited in mice that do not receive selumetinib. Thus, BRAFV600E amplification confers a selective disadvantage during drug withdrawal, providing a rationale for intermittent dosing to forestall resistance. In striking contrast, selumetinib resistance driven by KRASG13D amplification is not reversible. In these cells ERK1/2 reactivation does not inhibit proliferation but drives a ZEB1-dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that increases cell motility and promotes resistance to traditional chemotherapy agents arguing strongly against the use of ‘drug holidays’ in cases of KRASG13D amplification.",Homo sapiens

However, the internal structure of circRNA is hard to be determined since of the alternative splicing happened in exons and introns of circRNA and the cancer-specific alternative splicing of circRNA is less to be identified. Here we proposed a custom tool CircSplice, which could identify internal alternative splicing of circRNA and compare the differential splicing between samples.

ME/CFS patients (n=14) and matched sedentary controls (n=11) were subjected to cardiopulmonary exercise on 2 consecutive days and followed up to 7 days post-exercise, and longitudinal whole blood samples analyzed by RNA-seq. Although ME/CFS patients showed significant worsening of symptoms following exercise versus controls, with 8 of 14 ME/CFS patients showing oxygen consumption (V̇O2) on day 2, transcriptome analysis yielded only 6 differentially expressed gene (DEG) candidates when comparing ME/CFS patients to controls across all time points. None of the DEGs were related to immune signaling, and no DEGs were found in ME/CFS patients before and after exercise. Virome composition (P=0.746 by chi-square test) and number of viral reads (P = 0.098 by paired t-test) were not significantly associated with PEM.

Our aim was to elucidate the constitutional basis of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in LLS patients throughout a comprehensive genetic and epigenetic analysis. Methods: One hundred and fifteen LLS patients harboring MMR deficient tumors and no pathogenic germline MMR gene mutations were included in this study. Mutational analysis of 26 colorectal cancer associated genes was performed by using a customized multigene panel and massively parallel sequencing. Pathogenicity of MMR variants was assessed by mRNA analysis and multifactorial likelihood calculations. Genome-wide methylome analysis was perfomed by using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. Results: The multigene panel analysis revealed the presence of two MMR gene truncating mutations not found in previous analysis. Of a total of 15 MMR variants of unknown significance identified, five - present in 6 unrelated individuals- were reclassified as pathogenic. In addition, 13 predicted deleterious variants in other CRC-predisposing genes (MSH3, MUTYH, POLD1, APC, EPCAM, BUB1, FAN1, EXO1 or PSM1) were found in 12 probands. Methylome analysis detected one constitutional MLH1 epimutation in an individual diagnosed with CRC at age 42, but no additional differentially methylated regions were identified in LLS compared to LS patients or healthy individuals. Conclusions: In conclusion, the use of an ad-hoc designed gene panel combined with pathogenicity assessment of variants allows the identification of deleterious MMR mutations as well as new LLS candidate genes. Moreover, constitutional epimutations in non-LS-associated genes are not responsible for the MMR-deficient phenotype observed in LLS patients.",Homo sapiens
200128066,GSE128066,A Bayesian mixture model for clustering droplet-based single cell transcriptomic data from population studies,"Abstract: The recently developed droplet-based single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology makes it feasible to perform a population-scale scRNA-seq study, in which the transcriptome is measured for tens of thousands of single cells from multiple individuals. Despite the advances of many clustering methods, there are few tailored methods for population-scale scRNA-seq studies. Here, we develop a BAyesian Mixture Model for Single Cell sequencing (BAMM-SC) method to cluster scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals simultaneously. BAMM-SC takes raw count data as input and accounts for data heterogeneity and batch effect among multiple individuals in a unified Bayesian hierarchical model framework. Results from applications of BAMM-SC to in-house experimental scRNA-seq datasets using blood and lung cells from humans or mice demonstrate that BAMM-SC outperformed existing clustering methods with considerable improved clustering accuracy, particularly in the presence of heterogeneity among individuals. Data purpose: To evaluate the performance of BAMM-SC for clustering droplet-based scRNA-seq data in population-based study, we performed single cell RNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from whole blood obtained from 4 healthy donors, and on lung cells isolated from streptococcus pneumonia (SP) infected and naïve mice.",Homo sapiens; Mus musculus

200128040,GSE128040,Neural stem cells of Parkinson’s disease patients exhibit aberrant mitochondrial morphology and functionality,"Emerging evidence suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD), besides being an age-associated disorder, might also have a neurodevelopment component. Disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis has been highlighted as a crucial cofactor in its etiology. Here, we show that PD patient-specific human neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation recapitulate key mitochondrial defects previously described only in differentiated dopaminergic neurons. By combining high-content imaging approaches, 3D image analysis, and functional mitochondrial readouts we show that LRRK2-G2019S mutation caused aberrations in mitochondrial morphology and functionality compared to isogenic controls. LRRK2-G2019S NESCs displayed an increased number of mitochondria compared to isogenic control lines. However, these mitochondria were more fragmented and exhibited decreased membrane potential. Coherently, the release of total and mitochondrial redox oxidative species increased in LRRK2-G2019S NESC compared to controls. Functional alterations in LRRK2-G2019S cultures were also accompanied by a reduced mitophagic clearance via lysosomes. These findings support the hypothesis that preceding mitochondrial developmental defects contribute to the manifestation of the PD pathology later in life.",Homo sapiens
200096060,GSE96060,Gene Expression In Blood From an Individual With β-Thalassemia: an RNA Sequence Analysis,"Background: The thalassemias are highly diverse at both the molecular and clinical levels. Many of the HBB mutations that result in β-thalassemia are missense mutations in the coding region of the β-globin gene, but a few cause alternative splicing, and interfere with normal processing of the β-globin transcripts. Transcriptome profiling in individuals affected with β-thalassemia, especially in individuals who carry novel mutations in the HBB, may improve our understanding of the heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms of the disease. Methods: Members of a family with a daughter affected with thalassemia intermedia, although her mother was not clinically affected, were examined for physical characteristics, hematological parameters and β-globin gene sequences. We also characterized genome-wide gene expression in the family using RT-qPCR and high-throughput RNA-sequencing mRNA expression profiling of blood. Results: Clinical findings, hematological indices, DNA and RNA sequence analysis of individuals with β-thalassemia, including the description of a novel mutation in the β-globin gene, which introduces a cryptic donor splice site. More than 300 genes are differentially expressed in β-thalassemic blood with many of the DEGs involved in pathways relevant to the clinical management of β-thalassemia. β-thalassemia shows important similarities and differences with sickle cell disease at the transcriptome level. Conclusions: We described the down-regulation of the β-globin gene in β-thalassemia by RNA-sequencing analysis using a sample from an affected individual and her mother, who have a novel mutation in the HBB that creates a cryptic donor splice site. The daughter has a typical β-thalassemia allele as well, and an unexpectedly severe phenotype. The DEGs are enriched in pathways that are directly or indirectly related to β-thalassemia such as hemopoiesis, heme biosynthesis, response to oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, immune responses, control of circadian rhythm, apoptosis, and other cellular activities.

We then performed FOXA1 ChIP-seq and showed that the vast majority (>99%) of FOXA1 binding events are not affected by steroid conditions. A small number (<1%) of FOXA1 binding sites appear to be induced by estrogen, but these are not genuine de novo binding sites and represent ‘shadow’ binding sites that result from chromatin interactions at super-enhancer containing estrogen-regulated genomic regions.

200123055,GSE123055,Formative transition of human naïve pluripotent stem cells,"Human naïve pluripotent stem cells (PSC) share features with pre-implantation epiblast. They thus provide an unmatched opportunity for characterising the developmental programme of pluripotency in Homo sapiens. Here we confirm that naïve PSC do not respond directly to germ layer induction, but must first acquire competence. Capacitation for multi-lineage differentiation occurs without exogenous growth factor stimulation and is facilitated by inhibition of Wnt signalling. Whole transcriptome profiling during this formative transition highlights dynamic changes in gene expression, affecting many cellular properties, including metabolism and epithelialisation. Notably, naïve pluripotency factors are exchanged for post-implantation factors, but competent cells remain devoid of lineage primed transcription. The gradual pace of transition for human naïve PSC is consistent with the timespan of primate development from blastocyst to gastrulation. Transcriptome trajectory during in vitro capacitation of human naïve cells tracks the progression of epiblast during embryogenesis in Macaca fascicularis, but shows greater divergence from mouse development. Thus the formative transition of naïve PSC in a simple culture system may recapitulate essential and specific features of pluripotency dynamics during an inaccessible period of human embryogenesis.",Homo sapiens

They also employ multiple mechanisms to preserve the integrity of their genomes. Nucleotide excision repair, a versatile repair mechanism, removes bulky DNA adducts from the genome. However, the dynamics of the capacity of nucleotide excision repair during stem cell differentiation remain unclear. Here, using immunoslot blot assay, we measured repair rates of UV-induced DNA damage during differentiation of human embryonic carcinoma (NTERA-2) cells into neurons and muscle cells. Our results revealed that the capacity of nucleotide excision repair increases as cell differentiation progresses. We also found that inhibition of the apoptotic signaling pathway has no effect on nucleotide excision repair capacity. Furthermore, RNA-seq-based transcriptomic analysis indicated that expression levels of four core repair factors, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group A (XPA), XPC, XPG, and XPF-ERCC1, are progressively up-regulated during differentiation, but not those of replication protein A (RPA) and transcription factor IIH (TFIIH).

While inhibitors of DNA methylatransferase induced the highest levels of FMR1 mRNA expression, a combination of a DNMT inhibitor and a novel epigenetic agent was able to potentiate the effect of reactivating treatment. To better assess the rescue effect observed following direct demethylation, we characterized the long-term and genome-wide effects of FMR1 reactivation, and established an in vivo system for FMR1 reactivating therapy analysis. Systemic treatment with a DNMT inhibitor in mice carrying transplants of differentiated FXS-iPSCs was able to robustly induce FMR1 expression in the affected tissue, which was maintained for a prolonged period of time. Finally, we show a proof-of-principle for FMR1 reactivating therapy in the context of the central nervous system.",Homo sapiens

Here we study periventricular heterotopia (PH) by analyzing cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients with mutations in the cadherin receptor-ligand pair DCHS1 and FAT4 or from isogenic knock-out lines. Our results show that human cerebral organoids reproduce the cortical heterotopia associated with PH. Mutations in DCHS1 and FAT4 or knock-down of their expression cause changes in the morphology of neural progenitor cells and result in defective neuronal migration dynamics only in a subset of neurons.

To assess their immediate roles in nuclear RNA biology, we engineered cells where the 3’->5’ exoribonucleases of the exosome complex, Dis3 and EXOSC10, can be eliminated within 60 minutes. Loss of Dis3 has the greatest impact, causing thousands of enhancer RNAs, intragenic transcripts, promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) and products of premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) to accumulate. Interestingly, EXOSC10 only targets these substrates when Dis3 is absent, which is explained by its rapid mis-localization to the nucleoplasm following Dis3 loss. Direct detection of EXOSC10 substrates revealed a more specific role in trimming of short 3’ extensions on ribosomal and small nucleolar RNAs. Finally, the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease, Xrn2, has little activity on exosome substrates, but promotes termination following PCPA.

200127849,GSE127849,miR-27a is a pivotal regulator of the breast cancer stem cell state,"Comparison af adherent growing breast cancer cell lines versus mammospheres under serum-free conditions Background: In patients with breast cancer, subsets of long-lived cells tolerate chemotherapies. These chemoresistant cells can remain dormant at secondary sites, such as bone and lung, for years and decades. Cancer cells endowed with drug resistance are maintained in vivo in a quiescent slow-growing state that preserves them from anti-proliferative cancer drugs. The mechanism of conversion from dormancy to growth remains poorly understood. We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) as master regulators of cancer stem cells (CSCs) maintainance, because one of the characteristics of CSCs is their slow proliferation or dormancy. MiRNA targeting CSCs may be an effective therapy to improve the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Methods: We performed miRNA array analysis to identify differences miRNA expression profiles between adherent cells and mammospheres that contain higher number of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). In this approach, we focused on expression of hsa-miR-27a. Further, roles of hsa-miR-27a target genes in maintaining BCSC properties were analysed . Results: Here, we showed that hsa-miR-27a was downregulated in mammosphere cells. The formation of BCSCs was attenuated by transfection of hsa-miR-27a. We found that hsa-miR-27a targets F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7 (FBW7), a tumor suppressor gene, thereby inducing tumor dormancy. Additionally, we found that hsa-miR-27a targets genes involved in GSH synthesis, including xCT (encoded by SLC7A11), a heterodimeric protein of a transporter subunit of the xC(-) system, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH/CSE), and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2), thereby increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Upregulation of these genes by antisense (as)-miR-27a induced autophagy. Conclusions: Previous studies showed that expression of hsa-miR-27a is elevated in breast cancer. Here, we showed that expression of hsa-miR-27a was reduced in BCSC. CSCs in the dormant state are resistant to chemotherapy due to inhibition of ROS accumulation in these cells. These results demonstrate that hsa-miR-27a plays an essential role in maintaining the BCSCs phenotype via regulation of FBW7, ROS related genes and the Nrf2 pathway, as well as in the dormant-to-proliferative switch of breast cancer cells. Thus, hsa-miR-27a represents a novel strategy for various type of breast cancer.",Homo sapiens

RNA-Seq was performed on hippocampal tissue resected from 12 medically intractable TLE patients with pre-surgery seizure frequencies ranging from 0.33 to 120 seizures per month. Differential expression (DE) analysis of individuals with low (LSF, mean= 4 seizure/month) versus high (HSF, mean= 60 seizures/month) seizure frequency identified 979 genes with ≥2-fold change in transcript abundance (FDR-adjusted p-value <0.05). Comparisons with post-mortem controls revealed a large number of downregulated genes in the HSF (1,676) versus LSF (399) groups. More than 50 signaling pathways were inferred to be deactivated or activated, with Signal Transduction as the central hub in the pathway network. While neuroinflammation pathways were activated in both groups, key neuronal system pathways were systematically deactivated in the HSF group, including calcium, CREB and Opioid signaling. We also infer that enhanced expression of a signaling cascade promoting synaptic downscaling may have played a key role in maintaining a higher seizure threshold in the LSF cohort.

200127828,GSE127828,Dynamic imbalance between cancer cell subpopulations induced by Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) is associated with a DNA methylome switch [methylation],"Distinct subpopulations of neoplastic cells within tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), display pronounced ability to initiate new tumors and induce metastasis. Recent evidence suggests that signals from transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) may increase the survival of these so called tumor initiating cells leading to poor HCC prognosis. However, how TGF-β establishes and modifies the key features of these cell subpopulations is not fully understood. In the present report we describe the differential DNA methylome of CD133-negative and CD133-expressing liver cancer cells. Next, we show that TGF-β is able to increase the proportion of CD133+ cells in liver cancer cell lines in a way that is stable and persistent across cell division. This process is associated with stable genome-wide changes in DNA methylation that persist through cell division. Differential methylation in response to TGF-β is under-represented at promoter CpG islands and enriched at gene bodies, including a locus in the body of the de novo DNA methyl-transferase DNMT3B gene. Moreover, phenotypic changes induced by TGF-β, including the induction of CD133, are impaired by siRNA silencing of de novo DNA methyl-transferases. Our study reveals a self-perpetuating crosstalk between TGF-β signaling and the DNA methylation machinery, which can be relevant in the establishment of cellular phenotypes. This is the first indication of the ability of TGF-β to induce genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, resulting in a stable change in the proportion of liver cancer cell subpopulations.",Homo sapiens

200127791,GSE127791,Gene expression and epigenetic alterations in human hepatocytes treated with low doses of chemical carcinogens,"The increasing number of man-made chemicals in the environment that may pose a carcinogenic risk emphasizes the need for the development of reliable time- and cost-effective approaches for carcinogen detection. To address this issue, we have investigated the utility of human hepatocytes for the in vitro identification of genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human hepatocytes were treated with the genotoxic carcinogens aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and with the non-genotoxic liver carcinogen methapyrilene at non-cytotoxic concentrations for 7 days, and transcriptomic profile was examined. 1569 (892 protein-coding and 677 non-coding), 1693 (922 protein-coding and 771 non-coding), and 2061 (1462 protein-coding and 599 non-coding) differentially expressed genes were detected in cells treated with AFB1, B[a]P, and methapyrilene, respectively. Additionally, we examined the toxicogenomics response to AFB1, B[a]P, and methapyrilene exposure in human HepaRG cells and demonstrated that carcinogens had a less prominent effect on the cellular transcriptome as compared to that in human iPSC-derived hepatocytes. Overall, the results demonstrate that the prime non-genotoxic effect of exposure to carcinogens, regardless of their mode of action, in short-term in vitro testing is a profound global transcriptome response, indicating a greater value of toxicogenomics for rapid carcinogen screening in vitro.",Homo sapiens
200127770,GSE127770,Gene expression analysis of SJG6 CONTROL and NICD,"Mutational landscape of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is predominated by frequent inactivating mutations in EGF- like ligand binding domain of NOTCH1. However role of NOTCH1 signalling in tumorigenesis is highly context and cell type dependent. In this study, we investigated phenotypic effect of NOTCH1 mutations in primary line derived from OSCC biopsy. Based on gain-of-function assays in NOTCH1 mutant line we demonstrated regulation of cell behaviour and morphology, by NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) leading to changes in cell proliferation, migration, clonal growth and differentiation. Importantly, overexpression of NICD results in upregulation of ETV7/TEL2 which negatively regulates SERPINE1 expression and confers malignant cells with less aggressive phenotype. Further knockdown of SERPINE1 expression simulated the phenotypes observed upon rescue of NICD. In accord with our cell-based model we observed strong correlation between NOTCH1, ETV7 and SERPINE1 expression in OSCC primary tumours indicating similar deregulated mechanisms during oral carcinogenesis. Overall this study suggests a tumour suppressive role of NOTCH1 in OSCC and highlights possible mechanisms leading to changes in cell behaviour and morphology in absence of NICD potentially by regulating TEL2 and SERPINE1 expression.",Homo sapiens

200105109,GSE105109,Parallel profiling of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation highlights neuropathology-associated epigenetic variation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Background Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is hypothesized to involve epigenetic dysfunction. Previous studies of DNA modifications in Alzheimer’s disease have been unable to distinguish between DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation. DNA hydroxymethylation has been shown to be enriched in the human brain, although its role in Alzheimer’s disease has not yet been fully explored. Here we utilize oxidative bisulfite conversion, in conjunction with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K microarray, to identify neuropathology-associated differential DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation in the entorhinal cortex. Results We identified one experiment-wide significant differentially methylated position residing in the WNT5B gene. Next, we investigated pathology-associated regions consisting of multiple adjacent loci. We identified one significant differentially hydroxymethylated region consisting of four probes spanning 104 bases in the FBXL16 gene. We also identified two significant differentially methylated regions: one consisting of two probes in a 93 base-pair region in the ANK1 gene and the other consisting of six probes in a 99 base-pair region in the ARID5B gene. We also highlighted three regions that show alterations in unmodified cytosine: two probes in a 39 base-pair region of ALLC, two probes in a 69 base-pair region in JAG2, in addition to the same six probes in ARID5B that were differentially methylated. Finally we replicated significant ANK1 disease-associated hypermethylation and hypohydroxymethylation patterns across eight CpG sites in an extended 118 base-pair region in an independent cohort using oxidative-bisulfite pyrosequencing. Conclusions Our study represents the first epigenome-wide association study of both DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in Alzheimer’s disease entorhinal cortex. We demonstrate that previous estimates of DNA hypermethylation in ANK1 in Alzheimer’s disease were underestimates as it is confounded by hypohydroxymethylation.",Homo sapiens
200103404,GSE103404,Distinct cancer-promoting stromal gene expression depending on lung function,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that lung stromal cells activate pathological gene expression programs supporting oncogenesis. To identify molecular mechanisms operating in the lung stroma that support development of lung cancer. Study subjects included patients with- or without- lung cancer across a spectrum of lung function. We conducted multi-omics analysis of non-malignant lung tissue to quantify the transcriptome, translatome and proteome. Cancer-associated gene expression changes predominantly manifested as alterations in the efficiency of mRNA translation modulating protein levels in the absence of corresponding changes in mRNA levels. The molecular mechanisms driving these cancer-associated translation programs differed based on lung function. In subjects with normal to mildly impaired lung-function, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway served as an upstream driver; whereas in severe airflow obstruction, pathways downstream of pathological extracellular matrix (ECM) emerged. Consistent with a role during cancer initiation, both the mTOR and ECM gene expression programs paralleled activation of previously identified pro-cancer secretomes. Furthermore, in situ examination of lung tissue documented that stromal fibroblasts express cancer-associated proteins from the two pro-cancer secretomes including IL6 in mild or no airflow obstruction and BMP1 in severe airflow obstruction. Two distinct stromal gene expression programs promoting cancer initiation are activated in lung cancer patients depending on lung function. Our work has implications both for screening strategies and personalized approaches to cancer treatment.",Homo sapiens
