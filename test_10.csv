200117734,GSE117734,The mSWI/SNF ATPase module mediates subcomplex identity and non-catalytic targeting in SCCOHT [ChIP-seq],"Perturbations to mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes have been widely implicated as driving events across cancers1. One such perturbation is the dual loss of the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 ATPase subunits, which has recently been implicated in rare cancers such as small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT)2-5, SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcomas6 and dedifferentiated endometrial carcinomas7. The consequences of SMARCA4/2 dual loss on the biochemical composition of the complex, chromatin targeting and remodeling capabilities, and subcomplex identity (BAF vs. PBAF) in these cancers are unknown.  Here, we leverage SCCOHT cell lines to identify an unexpected ATPase module of mSWI/SNF subunits. Using biochemical and genome-wide profiling assays, we found that the incorporation of the ATPase module is a critical step in the functional specification of BAF and PBAF subcomplexes. Furthermore, by utilizing ATPase mutant variants, we found that the ATPase module mediates two separate and concurrent mSWI/SNF targeting mechanisms, evenly split between catalytically-independent targeting to primed enhancers/promoters and catalytically-dependent targeting to de novo enhancers. Finally, by linking these distinct sites to separate tumor-suppressive gene expression programs across ovarian tissues , we clarify the mechanistic consequences of SMARCA4/2 loss dual loss in these rare tumors.",Homo sapiens
200128119,GSE128119,COX-2 mediates tumor-stromal Prolactin signaling to initiate tumorigenesis [ChIP-seq],"Tumor-stromal communication within the microenvironment contributes to initiation of metastasis and may present a therapeutic opportunity. Using serial single cell RNA-sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find upregulation of Prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lung expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand Prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2). PGE-2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the nuclear orphan receptor NR4A (Nur77), with Prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-Retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of Prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib abrogates Prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation. Across multiple human cancers, COX-2, Prolactin, and Prolactin receptor show consistent differential expression in tumor and stromal compartments. Such paracrine crosstalk may thus contribute to the documented efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer suppression.",Homo sapiens
